Pyber Observations:
1. Urban cities tended to have lower fares/ride. This seems odd due to the idea of cost of living being higher
in urban areas and services having higher costs. So, an explanation could be that people in Urban cities take
shorter rides more often. People in rural areas have longer commutes and rides. 

2. There are a higher percentage of drivers in urban cities (86.7%) for percentage of rides (67%) compared to
suburban that had 12.5% of drivers but 26% of rides. It would be interesting to see the earning differentiation-
if suburban drivers are making more trips and making more money. They are making 30.5% of fares, but This 
equates to larger per-driver earnings. 

3. The small percentage of rural drivers are making a larger number of trips. This could be due to the lack
of technology adoption by rural residents, keeping them from taking on non-standard jobs such as a ride-share
driver. This means that for the few there are, there are more opportunities to drive.
